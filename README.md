# AR-Cube
 
Welcome to the AR Cube Project. Video Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q-OwPU41cI

The first step would be to clone the project from github to a local folder. This can be done with the git command line command "git clone". Secondly, one needs Unity and Vuforia. Specifically, the Vuforia 8.6.7 package must be imported. This is because the file-size was > 100 MB.

Unity: unity.com Vuforia: https://developer.vuforia.com/

Within the Unity Hub, you should first "Add Project", and select the AR Cube. Then once Vuforia is imported, click "Play".

Limitations and Strengths are addressed in the example video above.
